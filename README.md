# Amazon Flex Data Science & Analytics Project

### Introduction
Amazon’s Flex program hires qualified individuals as delivery partners or independent contractors to deliver Amazon orders.
Every contractor uses his/her vehicle to work the available block that he/she selects throughout Amazon Flex’s mobile application. 
Once the block and starting point is chosen, the delivery partner must show up to the selected warehouse to load the customers’ orders. 
Routes / delivery locations associated with each block are randomly assigned to contractors once these individuals arrive to the loading zone. 
The Amazon Flex Data Project is based on data that is manually compiled by an Amazon Delivery Contractor. After a series of observations and 
patterns, the author decided to compile information related to gasoline expenses, mileage, delivery performance, shift duration, total package 
number per block, etc. The 'Raw Data' serves as a building block for this project, which covers the following fields: business analytics, 
data engineering, and data science.
